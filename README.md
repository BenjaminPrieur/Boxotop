Boxotop
=======

Boxotop is a personal project.

It's realized with Objective-C

I implemented the following design patterns: 
- MVVM 
- Singleton

I used ReactiveCocoa for an easiest implementation of MVVM.  
AFNetworking : to manage connections with the API.  
Mantle : to auto parse the JSON.  
LBBlurredImage : to blur images.
